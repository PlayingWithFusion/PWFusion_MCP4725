* **************************************************************************
* APPLICATION SPECIFIC NOTES (READ THIS!!!):
* - This code configures an Arduino to interface with SEN-20001
*    - Configure Arduino (I2C, UART, etc)
*    - Perform initial verification and configuration of the DAC
* - I2C specific: This example uses the I2C interface via the Wire library
* 
* Circuit:
*    Arduino Uno   Arduino Mega  -->  SEN-20001
*    SDA:    SDA        SDA      -->  SDA
*    SCL:    SCL        SCL      -->  SCL
*    GND:    GND        ''       -->  GND
*    VDD:    5V         ''       -->  VDD
*    A0:     leave floating for address 0x62, pull high for 0x63
*    note: VDD should match voltage of IO, and can be between 2.7 and 5V
